# Golazon
> Football data [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/w/) way.

No cookies, no tracking scripts, no analytics, no popups, no ads,
no subscriptions, no social sharing, no comments, no images.
Zero bullshit. Just data.

It's a proof of concept, but it works pretty well already.

## Tech
> Built with [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact)

### Getting Started

* `yarn install`

### Development

* `yarn dev`
* `yarn deploy`

### Notes

* Golazon uses experimental proprietary API, which is neither open-sourced
  nor a part of this repository.
* Would be good to use Riak Search as a search engine
  (for AP -> Availability + Partition Tolerance)
* Earlier versions were built with Riot and Hyperapp.
  See [branches](https://github.com/sobstel/golazon/branches) for details.
